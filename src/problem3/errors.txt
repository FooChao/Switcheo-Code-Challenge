Error 0 : line ? : Missing imports
Solution : Add relevant imports

Error 1 : line 8 : "formatted" is a bad naming convention for a field
Solution : Change it to formattedAmount as per line 84

Error 2 : line 5 - 9 : Insufficient details is given but is is likely that FormattedWalletBalance is a kind of WalletBalance and should inherit it.
Solution : No actions will be taken due to lack of information but will clarify in actual job

Error 3 : line 15 - 17 : Unnecessary inheritance as Props does not add any new properties to BoxProps
Solution: Remove the Props interface and replace it with BoxProps

Error 4 : line 21 : Prices is likely to be an array and should not be initiialised as an empty object
Solution: Initialised it as an empty array instead

Error 5 : line 25 : prices as name of fetched prices may be confusing as it is the same as the useState name and do not have a type
Solution: Rename it as fetchedPrices but type not fixed due to lack of information

Error 6 : line 28 : 'console.err' is wrong
Solution : Change it to console.error

Error 7 : line 32 : Blockchain is of type any which defeats the whole point og TypeScript
Solution : Change it to type String or even an enum (but not enough info is given on whether the default case of not those String is valid in this case)

Error 8 : line 52 : Typo in lhspriority
Solution : Change it to balance priortiy

Error 9 : line 51-58 : Filter condition is weird and it more intutive to have >0
Solution : Change the condition to balancepriority > 0 (have to make this assumption due to lack of information)

Error 10 : blockchain not in WalletPage field
Solution : Add it in

Error 11 line 58 - 66 : Sort's boolean won't return any value when lhs priority = rhs priortiy
Solution : Add a return 0 when they are same

Error 12 : line 67 : Prices used in useMemo when it is not used in calculation resulting in unnecessary re-computation
Solution : Remove prices

Error 13: line 69 : Formatted balance is declared but never read
Solution : Will leave it as it is due to potential usage in some hidden code

Error 14 : line 69 : Type not declared for formatted balance
Solution : Add type declaration of Formatted Wallet Balance

Error 15 : line 72 : Likely to have a logic error as it does not makes sense that FormattedWalletBalance's formatted is just trauncated balance
Solution : Will leave it as it is for now due to lack of details of usage

Error 16 : line 80 : classes.row not declared (at least not in the portion I see)
Solution : Will leave it as it is due to lack of details of what it is supposed to be (or it may be declared in hidden portion)

Error 17 : Formatting error throughout (mainly due to line alignment)
Solution : Will fix it
